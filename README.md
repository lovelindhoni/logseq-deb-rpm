# GH action to build deb and rpm packages of [logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq)

- appimages suck for me
- these are untested, automated builds.
- Use it at your own risk. I would suggest you to audit the [action](https://github.com/lovelindhoni/logseq-deb-rpm/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml)
- fork this repo, enable actions on your fork and manually trigger the CI action.
- The deb, rpm packages would be uploaded as artifacts.
